# PHP MQTT client usage example

In this example, we provide the sample code for connecting to MQTT Broker through TCP and TLS protocols.

The example selects the client library `php-mqtt/client` with the most downloads on composer, and there are also [some](https://packagist.org/search/?query=mqtt) other excellent libraries based on [Swoole](https://www.swoole.com/) that welcome everyone to use it and submit the sample and list to it.

For more documentation about php-mqtt/client, please refer to [Packagist php-mqtt/client](https://packagist.org/packages/php-mqtt/client).
